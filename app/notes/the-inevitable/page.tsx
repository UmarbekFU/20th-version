                <strong>Becoming:</strong> Everything is in a constant state of becoming something else. 
                Products and services are never finished, always evolving and improving.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Cognifying:</strong> Intelligence is being added to everything. From simple objects 
                to complex systems, AI is making everything smarter and more capable.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Flowing:</strong> Information flows freely across networks, creating new opportunities 
                for sharing, collaboration, and innovation. The flow of data becomes more valuable than the data itself.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Screening:</strong> Screens are becoming the primary interface for human interaction 
                with information and each other. We're moving toward a screen-based culture.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Accessing:</strong> Ownership is being replaced by access. We're moving from a 
                possession-based economy to an access-based one, where experiences matter more than things.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Sharing:</strong> Collaboration and sharing are becoming the default modes of operation. 
                The sharing economy represents a fundamental shift in how we think about resources and value.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Filtering:</strong> As information becomes abundant, filtering becomes crucial. 
                The ability to find relevant, high-quality content becomes a key competitive advantage.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Remixing:</strong> Everything is becoming remixable. Digital content can be easily 
                combined, modified, and repurposed, leading to new forms of creativity and expression.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Interacting:</strong> We're moving from passive consumption to active interaction. 
                Technology is becoming more responsive and engaging, creating immersive experiences.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Tracking:</strong> Everything is being monitored and measured. Data collection 
                is becoming ubiquitous, enabling new insights and optimization opportunities.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Questioning:</strong> The answers are becoming less important than the questions. 
                In a world of abundant information, asking the right questions becomes the key skill.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Beginning:</strong> We're still in the early stages of the digital revolution.
