My atomic ideas are half-formed thoughts I'm working through. I build stuff. I'm solving my own problem. If it helps you too, even better. I take notes when I read. Not polished summaries, just the parts that made me stop and think. I list everything I consume—books, films, podcasts etc. If you care about tools I use, I keep that updated. You can find screenshots that made me think, code snippets I might need later, memes that contain truth on scrapbook. Read more about me.",

      "content": "I'm Samarkandi. I was born in 2006 in a village in the Past Darg'om district of Samarkand. The last few years, I've been living in Tashkent. I want to create things — tools, websites, essays, startups, apps, systems, and especially new ideas. I also want to learn — new ways of thinking, new ways of living. That's why I read books. I want to connect with people who feel the same: who stretch, strive, and grow. My favorite days are the ones where I work from morning to night, pausing only to move a little. I call it \"work,\" but really it's play — writing, learning, improving, and creating. I don't like labels. In my mind, someone self-identified with something typically means that person is a fraud. I like to identify with the problem I'm currently working on. I believe in skin in the game. This means: don't tell me what to do if you don't pay the price when you're wrong. Don't give advice you won't take yourself. Don't pretend to be a hero on other people's risks. I do not believe in perfect plans. Plans collapse on contact with reality. The world is too uncertain to be predicted with confidence. Instead of trying to know the future, I try to position myself so I don't need to know it. I do not chase rigid goals. Goals can blind me to opportunities. I prefer experiments. Experiments cost little, fail safely, and teach me something every time. Most of life's best outcomes come from tinkering, not planning. The world rewards those who try things, fail cheaply, and double down when something clicks. I have no respect whatsoever for authority. Someone's title, position, or reputation means absolutely nothing. Their words either make sense or they don't. Forget who said it and instead look what he starts with, where he ends up, and ask yourself, 'Is it reasonable?'",
